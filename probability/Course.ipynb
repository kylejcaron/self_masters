    " * Describe possible outcomes\n",
    " * Describe beliefs about likelihood of outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "__Steps__\n",
    " * List (set) of possible outcomes, $\\Omega$, the __sample space__\n",
    " \n",
    " * This list must be:\n",
    "     * __Mutually exclusive__ (This means that only 1 of the outcomes was possible)\n",
    "     * __Collectively Exhaustive__\n",

    "## Probability Axioms\n",
    "---\n",
    "*Which outcomes are more likely to occur, and which are less likely to occur?*\n",
    "\n",
    " * In a continuous model, any individual point should have a probability of zero. Consider trying to hit an exact center of a point with a dart - not very likely, expecially if the point is the size of the darts tip\n",
    " * __Instead__ of assigning probabilities to individual points, we assign probabilities to whole sets (a subset of the sample space)\n",
    " \n",
    "__Event__: a subset of the sample space\n",
    " * Probability is assigned to events\n",
    " * __Example__: A dart falls in the upper half of the dartboard\n",
    " \n",
    "### The Axioms:\n",
    " * __Nonnegativity: P(event) >= 0__\n",
    "     * The probability of the event occurring can't be negative\n",
    " * __Normalization: P($\\Omega$) = 1__\n",
    "     * The probability of the entire sample space should always \n",
    "     * The outcome is always going to be an element of a sample space, so we have absolute certainty that the outcome is going to be in the sample space\n",
    "     * We have absolute certainty that event $\\Omega$ will occur\n",
    " * __(Finite) additivity:__ (to be strengthened later)\n",
    "     * If $A \\cap B = \\varnothing$, then $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $\n",
    "     * If the intersection of two sets is empty, then the probability that the outcome of the experiment falls in the union of A and B is simply P(A) + P(B) \n",
    "     \n",
    "#### Exercise 1\n",
    "__Problem__: Let  𝐴  and  𝐵  be events on the same sample space, with  𝐏(𝐴)=0.6  and  𝐏(𝐵)=0.7 . Can these two events be disjoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer__: No, if they were disjoint then P(A) + P(B) = 0.6 + 0.7 = 1.3. Since 1.3 > 1, this would contradict the normalization axiom\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2\n",
    "__Problem__: Let  𝐴 ,  𝐵 , and  𝐶  be disjoint subsets of the sample space. For each one of the following statements, determine whether it is true or false. Note: \"False\" means \"not guaranteed to be true.\"\n",
