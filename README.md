# Introduction
---
I was recently laid off due to the Covid-19 outbreaks impact on the travel industry. To stay sharp and make the most of this time in self-isolation, I'll be pursuing an Open Source Machine Learning Masters (and hopefully sharpening my interviewing skills as well). The inspiration comes from [William Wolf's excellent blog](http://willwolf.io/) and his experience expanding his knowledge of Machine Learning through the plethora of resources available online for little to no cost.

Some topics I'm particularly interested in studying:
 * Interrupted Times Series / Policy Analysis
 * Bayesian Statistics
 * Multilevel Regression
 * Variational Bayes
 * Markov Chains and Attribution Modeling
 * Time Series Forecasting
 * Econometrics
 * Deep Learning with Tensorflow 2.0
 * Customer Lifetime Value
 * Survival Analysis
 * Statistical Theory and Probability Theory
 * Stochastic Processes
 * Linear and Non-Linear Optimization Methods 
 
The goal is to hopefully dive into all of these over the next 2 years, but it's quite a lofty goal. Hopefully over these next three months I'll start to make a dent in it.
